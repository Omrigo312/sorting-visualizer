# Sort It Out!

### This project is a sorting algorithms visualizer, to help computer science students study some of the most common sorting algorithms!

### Technologies:
In this project i have used React & Redux, Typescript, MaterialUI.

### Algorithms:
I just Googled 'most popular sorting algorithms' and took the top 4 - BubbleSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, QuickSort.

### Overall:
I have written this project entirely by myself (although the idea was inspired by a youtube video...)
I encourage you to have a look! https://omrigo312.github.io/sorting-visualizer/
